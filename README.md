# EduShield: Early Student Dropout Risk Prediction & Intervention System

EduShield is an **explainable machine learning system** designed to identify students at risk of dropping out **early in the semester**.

The system combines **behavioral engagement data, academic performance indicators, and sentiment signals from student forum activity** to predict dropout risk and recommend targeted interventions.

EduShield includes:

• A full **machine learning pipeline**

• **Explainable AI analysis using SHAP**

• An **interactive Streamlit analytics dashboard** for educators and advisors

---

# Problem

Student dropout is a major challenge in higher education and online learning environments.

Traditional approaches often detect dropout **too late**, when intervention is no longer effective.

EduShield aims to:

• Detect dropout risk **early in the learning cycle**

• Explain **why a student is at risk**

• Suggest **targeted interventions**

• Provide educators with **actionable analytics tools**

---

# Key Features

## Early Dropout Prediction

Machine learning models estimate the probability of student dropout using:

• learning engagement metrics

• assessment performance indicators

• behavioral activity patterns

• sentiment signals from student discussions

---

## Explainable AI (SHAP)

Predictions are explained using **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**.

This allows educators to understand:

• which features contributed to a student's risk score

• how engagement or academic performance affects predictions

• which factors require immediate intervention

---

## Intervention Recommendation Engine

Based on model explanations, the system suggests actionable interventions such as:

• engagement reminders

• tutoring support

• deadline flexibility discussions

• advisor outreach

• emotional or counseling support

---

## Interactive Analytics Dashboard

A **Streamlit dashboard** provides real-time analytics including:

• dropout probability for individual students

• explainable AI feature importance

• cohort risk visualization

• engagement simulations

• identification of high-risk students

---

## Risk Simulation

Educators can simulate behavioral changes (such as increased engagement activity) to observe how a student's **dropout risk may change over time**.

This enables proactive academic support strategies.

# Dashboard Overview

The interactive dashboard provides the following analytics and monitoring tools:

• Key cohort metrics

- Total students
- High risk student count
- Average risk score
- Historical dropout rate

• Course dropout distribution analysis

• Highest risk student leaderboard

• Individual student selection and profile view

• Predicted dropout probability for selected student

• Risk gauge visualization

• SHAP explanation of prediction drivers

• Global model feature importance analysis

• SHAP beeswarm feature impact distribution

• Early warning engagement simulation

• Sentiment indicators from forum analysis

- negative sentiment ratio
- negative post count

• Automated intervention recommendations

• Advisor intervention monitoring table for high-risk students

• Course dropout heatmap visualization

• Cohort engagement risk progression simulation

---

# Machine Learning Models

Multiple models were evaluated for dropout prediction:

• Logistic Regression (Baseline)

• Random Forest

• Logistic Regression with SMOTE (class imbalance handling)

• XGBoost

---

# Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated on a **70 / 30 train-test split**.

Dataset size: **32,593 students**

Test samples: **9,778 students**

| Model                          | Accuracy | Precision (Dropout=1) | Recall (Dropout=1) | F1 Score (Dropout=1) | ROC-AUC   |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| Logistic Regression (Baseline) | 0.86     | 0.77                  | 0.81               | 0.79                 | 0.937     |
| Random Forest                  | 0.88     | 0.78                  | 0.84               | 0.81                 | 0.947     |
| Logistic Regression + SMOTE    | 0.86     | 0.76                  | 0.82               | 0.79                 | 0.933     |
| XGBoost                        | **0.88** | **0.79**              | 0.83               | **0.81**             | **0.950** |

XGBoost achieved the **highest ROC-AUC (0.95)** and strong overall performance.

Therefore **XGBoost was selected as the primary model for the dashboard deployment**.

# Dataset

The system uses the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)**.

The dataset contains:

• student demographics

• course information

• assessment results

• learning activity engagement

• registration activity

Additional engineered features include:

• sentiment indicators derived from simulated forum posts

• behavioral engagement metrics

• temporal activity indicators
